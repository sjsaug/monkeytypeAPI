# monkeytypeAPI

**This project is for the MonkeyType typing website made by Miodec. Not to be confused with MonkeyType by Instagram.**

### How to setup
1. Generate an ApeKey from the MonkeyType danger zone and copy it (make sure to activate it)
2. Create a `.env` file and put **APE_KEY = YOUR_APE_KEY** (replace **YOUR_APE_KEY** with the one you generated in step 1)
3. Run the Python file
